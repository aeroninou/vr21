# Eloquent JavaScript

# Chapter 1:

- a modern computer had 30 billion bits in volatile data storage.
- seperated by values in Javascript
- every value has a type like number or text
- create a value by involking its name
- Quintillion numbers of memory for numbers
- numbers can use arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, / and %)
- strings can have any type of quotes but must start and end in same one
- string concat uses + or `${}`
- comparasions (==, !=, ===, <,>, >=, <= )
- ternary operator use ?:
- type coercion is when Javascript tried to convert a value to the type it needs

# Chapter 2:

- To catch and hold values JS uses binding or variable.
- names can be used with $ and \_ but no other special characters
- THe enviorment is what holds all these variables
